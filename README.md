## Overview

Welcome to the **Headlight Remote Script**! This script allows players to change the headlight color of their vehicles easily using a remote control item. You can customize your vehicleâ€™s aesthetics with a variety of vibrant colors.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following resources:

- **qb-inventory:** The inventory management system for handling items.
- **qb-menu:** (Optional if you want to use `qb-menu`)
- **ox_lib:** (Optional if you want to use `ox_lib`)

## Item Details

The remote control item is defined as follows:
```lua

    ['name'] = 'distancionno',
    ['label'] = 'Remote for colored headlights',
    ['weight'] = 100,
    ['type'] = 'item',

```

## Error Handling

- If you attempt to change the color while not in a vehicle or not in the driverâ€™s seat, you will receive an error message.
- If an invalid color ID is selected, you will be notified of the invalid input.

## Configuration
